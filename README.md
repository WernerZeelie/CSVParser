# CSVParser
Technical Test for Vas-X (PTY) Ltd

Author: Werner Zeelie

1. Run the main class (CSVParser).
2. Type in the filepath of the CSV file you want to parse (for this application I used the employee.csv file provided) into your terminal window.
3. A CSVSummary.txt file will be generated in the test folder of the project containing a summarized version of the CSV file.
